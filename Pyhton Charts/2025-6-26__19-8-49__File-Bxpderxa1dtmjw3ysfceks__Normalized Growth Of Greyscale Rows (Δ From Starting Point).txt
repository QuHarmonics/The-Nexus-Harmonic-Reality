Title:
Normalized Growth of Greyscale Rows (Δ from Starting Point)

Prompt:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Reconstruct the grid as described in the document
# Each row is a sequence of eight values (excluding the first col which is a label)

grid_rows = [
    [16777215],  # #FFFFFF
    [15658734],
    [14540253],
    [13421772],
    [12303291],
    [11184810],
    [10075235],  # Derived 1
    [ 17856854]  # Derived 2
]

# All rows are implicitly of length 1 in the sample; assume all should have 8 values for plotting
# We'll simulate rows extending by repeating synthetic patterns for the demonstration

# Generate dummy row extensions (simulate increasing values across 8 cols from first value)
extended_rows = []
for row in grid_rows:
    start = row[0]
    simulated_row = [start + i * 10000 for i in range(8)]
    extended_rows.append(simulated_row)

# Calculate delta (difference between each element and the first in the row)
rate_series = []
for row in extended_rows:
    base = row[0]
    rate_row = [val - base for val in row]
    rate_series.append(rate_row)

# Plot each row's growth from (1,1) as requested
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
x_vals = [i for i in range(8)]

for idx, deltas in enumerate(rate_series):
    y_vals = [1 + delta for delta in deltas]  # start from y=1
    x_shifted = [1 + i for i in x_vals]       # start from x=1
    plt.plot(x_shifted, y_vals, marker='o', label=f"Row {idx+1}")

plt.title("Normalized Growth of Greyscale Rows (Δ from Starting Point)")
plt.xlabel("Normalized X Position (starting at 1)")
plt.ylabel("Δ from Start Value (starting at 1)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
