Title:
Resonance Across Higher Dimensions

Prompt:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualizing Higher Dimensional Interactions

# 1. Resonance vs. Dimensions
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for overlap in overlap_ratios:
    overlap_data = higher_dimensional_df[higher_dimensional_df['Overlap Ratio'] == overlap]
    plt.plot(overlap_data['Dimension'], overlap_data['Resonance'], label=f"Overlap: {overlap}")

plt.title("Resonance Across Higher Dimensions")
plt.xlabel("Dimension")
plt.ylabel("Resonance")
plt.legend(title="Overlap Ratio", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.grid()
plt.show()

# 2. Stability Factor vs. Dimensions
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for overlap in overlap_ratios:
    overlap_data = higher_dimensional_df[higher_dimensional_df['Overlap Ratio'] == overlap]
    plt.plot(overlap_data['Dimension'], overlap_data['Stability Factor'], label=f"Overlap: {overlap}")

plt.title("Stability Factors Across Higher Dimensions")
plt.xlabel("Dimension")
plt.ylabel("Stability Factor")
plt.legend(title="Overlap Ratio", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.grid()
plt.show()

# 3. Stable States (Harmonically Aligned)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
stable_data = higher_dimensional_df[higher_dimensional_df['Is Harmonically Stable'] == True]
plt.scatter(stable_data['Dimension'], stable_data['Overlap Ratio'], color='green', label="Stable Interactions")
plt.title("Harmonically Stable States Across Higher Dimensions")
plt.xlabel("Dimension")
plt.ylabel("Overlap Ratio")
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
