Title:


Prompt:
# Visualize the pre-hash structure with a softer color scheme
# Differentiate zeros with a separate color

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))

# Define a colormap where zeros are shown in a softer color
cmap = plt.cm.magma.copy()
cmap.set_bad(color='lightgray')  # Set background for missing values

# Convert binary grid into masked array (treating zeros separately for a softer display)
masked_grid_real = np.ma.masked_where(grid_real == 0, grid_real)
masked_folded_grid_real = np.ma.masked_where(folded_grid_real == 0, folded_grid_real)

# Original Grid
ax[0].imshow(masked_grid_real, cmap="magma", interpolation="nearest")
ax[0].set_title(f"Original {square_size}×{square_size} Pre-Hash Structure Grid")

# Folded Grid with softer zero visualization
ax[1].imshow(masked_folded_grid_real, cmap="magma", interpolation="nearest")
ax[1].set_title(f"Diagonally Folded {square_size}×{square_size} Grid")

plt.show()
