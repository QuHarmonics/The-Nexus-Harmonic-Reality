Title:


Prompt:
# Constants for the speed of light squared
c_squared = (3e8) ** 2  # Speed of light squared in m^2/s^2

# Define masses for expected E = mc^2 results at each interaction level (scaled arbitrarily for demonstration)
# Since we're scaling, these masses are hypothetical examples to compare against the formula results
masses = [1e-10 * count for count in interaction_counts]  # Mass in kg based on interaction scaling
expected_energies = [m * c_squared for m in masses]  # E = mc^2 expected energies

# Plot the calculated vs. expected results
