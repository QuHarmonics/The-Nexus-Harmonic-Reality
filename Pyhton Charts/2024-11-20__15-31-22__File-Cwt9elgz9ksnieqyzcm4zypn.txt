Title:


Prompt:
# Create a directed graph to represent the flowchart of an atom's path and branches
G_atom = nx.DiGraph()

# Define the layers and their connections leading to an atom and branching from it
atom_branches = [
    # Path leading to the atom
    ("Quantum Fields", "Quarks"),  # Base quantum fields give rise to quarks
    ("Quarks", "Protons"),  # Quarks combine to form protons
    ("Quarks", "Neutrons"),  # Quarks combine to form neutrons
    ("Protons", "Atomic Nucleus"),  # Protons and neutrons form the nucleus
    ("Neutrons", "Atomic Nucleus"),
    ("Atomic Nucleus", "Atom"),  # Nucleus combines with electrons to form the atom

    # Branching from the atom
    ("Atom", "Molecules"),  # Atoms bond to form molecules
    ("Molecules", "Macromolecules"),  # Molecules combine into macromolecules
    ("Macromolecules", "Cells"),  # Macromolecules form cells in biological systems
    ("Atom", "Crystals"),  # Atoms arrange into crystal structures
    ("Atom", "Materials"),  # Atoms aggregate to form materials
]

# Add nodes and edges to the graph
G_atom.add_edges_from(atom_branches)

# Create a layout for better visualization
pos_atom = nx.spring_layout(G_atom, seed=42)

# Plot the graph
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
nx.draw(
    G_atom,
    pos_atom,

    node_size=3000,
    node_color="lightgreen",
    font_size=10,
