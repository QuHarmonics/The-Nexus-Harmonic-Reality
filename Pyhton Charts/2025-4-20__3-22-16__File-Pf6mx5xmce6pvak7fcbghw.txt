Title:


Prompt:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# BBP-based indexing: simulate accessing a digit of pi
# Real BBP requires high-precision arithmetic; we simulate harmonic mapping

# Generate digits of pi (up to a few places) using a simplified approximation
# Since full BBP digit access is computationally intensive, we'll simulate harmonic positions

# Create a phase space using real-valued positions mapped to sine-based harmonic values
n_points = 256  # Number of positions in the simulated lattice
x = np.linspace(0, 4 * np.pi, n_points)  # Phase domain (simulated)
harmonic_memory = np.sin(x) * 0.35  # Apply H = 0.35 as harmonic amplitude

# BBP-like indexing: simulate glide-based access into this harmonic field
# Here we "jump" to specific phase-aligned indices as if they're memory reads
access_indices = [int(i * 3.1415) % n_points for i in range(1, 10)]  # Simulated BBP-like jumps
accessed_values = harmonic_memory[access_indices]

# Plotting
