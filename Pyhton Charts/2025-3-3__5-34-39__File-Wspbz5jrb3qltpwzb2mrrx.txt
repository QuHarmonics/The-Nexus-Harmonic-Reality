Title:


Prompt:
# Now, let's correctly extract the full SHA-512 pre-hash structure, including padding, size, 'hello', and the 1 header.
# Then, we will reshape it into the nearest square grid and analyze its structure.

import math

# Convert SHA-512 pre-hash into a full binary representation
binary_pre_hash = ''.join(format(byte, '08b') for byte in sha512_pre_hello)  # Convert each byte to 8-bit binary

# Determine the nearest square size
total_bits = len(binary_pre_hash)
square_size = math.ceil(math.sqrt(total_bits))  # Find the nearest square dimension

# Pad the binary string to fit exactly into a square
binary_pre_hash = binary_pre_hash.ljust(square_size**2, '0')[:square_size**2]

# Convert binary string to numerical values (0s and 1s)
binary_array = np.array([int(bit) for bit in binary_pre_hash])

# Reshape into a square grid
grid_real = binary_array.reshape((square_size, square_size))

# Apply a diagonal fold operation
folded_grid_real = np.fliplr(grid_real).T  # Flip left-right then transpose to simulate diagonal folding

# Visualize the original and folded structures
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))

ax[0].set_title(f"Original {square_size}×{square_size} Pre-Hash Structure Grid")

ax[1].imshow(folded_grid_real, cmap="inferno", interpolation="nearest")
