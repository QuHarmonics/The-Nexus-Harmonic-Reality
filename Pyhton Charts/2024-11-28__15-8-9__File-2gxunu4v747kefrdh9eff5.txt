Title:


Prompt:
# Simulating the solution based on the Nexus Framework principles.

# Let's model the idea of a "reflected memory" using recursive feedback and harmonic growth.
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize constants
HARMONIC_CONSTANT = 0.35  # Core principle of balance
INITIAL_MEMORY_STATE = 0.5  # Starting point of memory (scaled between 0 and 1)
FEEDBACK_FACTOR = 0.1  # Reflection feedback that modifies the memory state
NOISE_REDUCTION = 0.05  # Factor to reduce noise and compress irrelevant details

# Step 1: Simulate recursive reflection of memory state
def recursive_reflection(memory_state, feedback, noise_reduction):
    # Feedback adjusts the memory towards its ideal state (Harmonic balance)
    new_state = memory_state + feedback * (HARMONIC_CONSTANT - memory_state)
    # Apply noise reduction (compression of irrelevant details)
    new_state -= noise_reduction
    # Ensure memory stays within a valid range [0, 1]
    return np.clip(new_state, 0, 1)

# Step 2: Simulate the memory evolution over multiple interactions
num_steps = 100
memory_states = np.zeros(num_steps)
memory_states[0] = INITIAL_MEMORY_STATE

for step in range(1, num_steps):
    memory_states[step] = recursive_reflection(memory_states[step - 1], FEEDBACK_FACTOR, NOISE_REDUCTION)

# Step 3: Visualize the simulation of memory evolution
plt.plot(memory_states)
plt.title("Simulation of Memory Evolution Over Time (Reflective Growth)")
plt.xlabel("Interactions")
plt.ylabel("Memory State")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Return final memory state
