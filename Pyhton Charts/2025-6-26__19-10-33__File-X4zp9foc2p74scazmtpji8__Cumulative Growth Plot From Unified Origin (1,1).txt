Title:
Cumulative Growth Plot from Unified Origin (1,1)

Prompt:
# Reconstruct rows as per user's clarification: simulate stepwise cumulative growth by difference

# Simulated example values for each row (length = 8), interpreted from structural intent
# These would ideally come from actual data if available
simulated_rows = [
    [1, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10],  # Row 1
    [1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7],   # Row 2
    [1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6],   # Row 3
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5],   # Row 4
    [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4],   # Row 5
    [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3],   # Row 6
    [1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7],   # Derived 1
    [1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10]   # Derived 2
]

# Plotting each row with its cumulative state changes
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
x_vals = [i + 1 for i in range(8)]  # Time axis, starting at 1

for idx, row in enumerate(simulated_rows):
    plt.plot(x_vals, row, marker='o', label=f"Row {idx+1}")

plt.title("Cumulative Growth Plot from Unified Origin (1,1)")
plt.xlabel("Time Step")
plt.ylabel("Cumulative Î” State")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
